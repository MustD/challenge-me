# Algorithm Practice Repository
## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems from platforms like LeetCode and algorithm books. It serves as a personal collection of algorithms and data structure implementations in Kotlin.
## Project Structure
The project is organized into packages based on problem categories:
- `leetcode`: Main package for solutions
    - `array_string`: Array and string manipulation problems
    - `backtracking`: Backtracking algorithm problems
    - `hash_map`: Hash map-related problems
    - `sliding_window`: Sliding window technique problems
    - `db_multi`: Various difficult problems

## Problem Solutions
Solutions are named with a prefix indicating the source and problem number:
- `I####`: LeetCode problems (e.g., `I0001twoSum.kt`, `I0383ransomNote.kt`)
- `C4`: Custom implementations or book problems

Examples include:
- Two Sum
- Add Two Numbers
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays
- Valid Sudoku
- Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

## Environment
- Kotlin 2.1.20
- JVM Toolchain 21
- JUnit 5.11.4 for testing

## Build and Test
This project uses Gradle as the build system.
To build the project:
``` bash
./gradlew build
```
To run tests:
``` bash
./gradlew test
```
## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A personal reference for algorithm implementations
- Practice for solving algorithmic problems
- Preparation for technical interviews
- A learning resource for understanding common algorithmic patterns

## License
This project is available for personal use and learning purposes.
